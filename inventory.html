                     <h3>Pricing</h3>
                     <hr>
                     <p> By driving prices up during high peak periods and knowing how much to discount prices by to ensure rooms are 
                        rented during low peak periods, hotels can maximise their return. Through dynamic pricing, businesses can provide
                        discounts and incentives in a controlled way during different seasons. </p>

                     <h3>Distribution</h3>
                     <hr>
                     <p> Tourism generally advertise their rooms through multiple channels, such as online travel agencies, to optimise reach 
                        and promote sales. Distribution management is essential and this involves calculating the minimum numbers of rooms 
                        needing to be sold for any given period by each channel. In doing so, you then have the ability to make informed 
                        choices regarding reallocation from cancellations or where to list spare rooms to maximise sales. </p>

                     <h3>Market Segmentation</h3>
                     <hr>
                     <p> Being aware of your market and the variable preferences, demands and affordability of different demographics are 
                        paramount to understanding how to price and distribute your room sales across the various channels. Not only does 
                        this help in managing your existing rooms, but it can also allow you to capture more of the market and increase sales and revenue. </p>
